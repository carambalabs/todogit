## Storybook

## Recommended VSCode addons
Although you can use any editor, we strongly recommend Visual Studio Code. 
In case you use VSCode install the folling extensions that will make working with the project more pleasant: 

- [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)
* [Editorconfig](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode)
* [Jest](https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest)
* [React Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.ReactSnippets)
:bulb: *If you are using the `flow-for-vscode` plugin, make sure to disable the `flowtype-errors/show-errors` eslint rule in the `.eslintrc` by setting it to `0`*
